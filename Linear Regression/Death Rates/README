For this exercise, I have used the data from: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x28.txt

There are 60 rows and 17 columns

This is the data regarding the death rates as a function of other variables like Population, Temperatures etc.

I have split the data for train and test purposes (75% and 25%). I have used the Gradient descent algorithm to find the parameters.

Cost varies over a range of 200-300 with every trail due to the random number generator I've used to pick the training set.

I found that the relative pollution potential of oxides of Nitrogen has a great effect on death rates followed by the size of the nonwhite population. Death rate increases with nitric oxide pollution.

DeathRates_LinearReg.m is the file where I placed the code.
